My PHP blog project

I'm fairly new to PHP as a language, so I made a simple blog page to get an idea of the fundamentals and how the language works. Made this without a framework, created my own classes and utilities for fetching data from the database as well as a few general output and formatting functions. All CSS written by me, as well as some of the javascript with the exception of a few jQuery plug-ins.
