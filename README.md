## My PHP blog project

, so I made a simple blog page to get an idea of the fundamentals and how the language works. I created my own classes and utilities for fetching data from the database as well as a few general output and formatting functions.

This is a pretty standard blog, you can register an account, log in, make posts, make comments.. Used several jQuery plugins such as modals and a wysiwyg editor to make the site more modern and streamlined.

Still need to add a lot of functionality, such as user pictures and a profile page, several customization options to the blog, the ability to comment on posts other than your own, but wanted to get a prototype out there to see how it works on production.
